Module 16 Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (README.md)

Overview of the analysis: 

Analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.   Amazon Vine is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products from customers who pays for membership.  Some companies pay a small fee and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.  From the published review the analysis will determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. The written summary of the analysis is provided below.


Results: 

•	There were 2 Vine reviews and 1047514 non-Vine reviews.
•	There were 2 Vine reviews with 5 stars and 1999 non-Vine reviews with 5 stars.
•	.0009 percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars and .999 percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

Summary: 

According the results out of the 5 stars reviews 99.9 percent were given by non-Vine members and only .09 percent from Vine members.  Therefore, the results clearly state that there was no positive bias for reviews in the Vine program.  To support the previous statement, we can add more statistical analysis by counting how many times each Vine members purchase from the company and analyze their revies again.
